# Instances-for-Discrete-Stochastic-Location-Problems-with-Congestion

In this repository, you can find the instances that were used for the paper "Conic Reformulations for a Class of Discrete Stochastic Location Problems with Congestion."

The first three rows represent the number of population zones ( $|I|$ ), the number of potential facilities ( $|J|$ ), and the number of capacity choices ( $|K|$ ). The next row indicates the demand mean reate ( $\lambda_i$ ). The next $|I|$ rows indicate the travel time of clients from zone $i$ to facility location $j$ ( $t_{ij}$ ). The next $|J|$ rows indicate the average service rate of facilities ( $\mu_{jk}$ ). The following $|J|$ rows display the fixed cost of installation and operation of facilities ( $f_{jk}$ ) and the next $|J|$ rows indicate the coefficient of variation of service times of facilities ( $cv_{jk}$ ). The last two values specify the weight of the queuing time components in objective function ( $\alpha_w$ ) and total available budget ( $B$ ).
